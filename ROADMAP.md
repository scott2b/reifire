# Reifire 🔥 project roadmap

## Project description

Reifire is a library / toolkit that empowers the reification of natural language prompts
into visual objects. The project was inspired by page 28 of the _Microsoft New Future of Work Report 2024_
which can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2024/12/NFWReport2024_12.20.24.pdf)

The relevant content of that report follows:

> Initial evidence on post-chat interaction techniques suggests that they could help solve prompt engineering hurdles
> The principle of reification in human-computer interaction turns abstract commands into persistent reusable interface objects, which affords several benefits to users (Beaudoin-Lafon 2000). We can apply this principle to user prompts (or fragments of prompts), embodying them into interactive graphical objects persistent on screen for users to store and reuse multiple times, as well as alter and combine at will. Riche et al. (2024) call this next generation of widgets: “AI-instruments”.
>
> An initial qualitative study with 12 users shows a few advantages of AIinstruments over more linear typing-based interactions:
>   • Generating interactive objects surfacing different dimensions (or
aspects of a prompt) eliminates the need for users to articulate them in
their own words.
>   - Simple interactions with objects to add/remove dimensions or suggest
different dimensions facilitates exploration and iterative content
generation.
>   - Persistent objects on screen can be stored, combined and most importantly reused with minimal effort.
